			<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
			<p>Hey guys! My name is Daniel Duany. I've only been programming for about two weeks now but it has been absolutely amazing. I'm really looking forward to learning more about HTML and CSS. I'm part of a cohort at LaGuardia Community College's Tech Hire program. We just finished learning about P5 and I'm really excited to keep learning.</p>
			<p>I come from a really large family on Long Island. I have four brother and one sister and we all get along really well. I know we shouldn't pick favorites but my sister is everything to me. I hope we become best friends when she gets older.</p>

			<!-- <p>I've spent the past five years at a cook in different restaurants in Manhattan. It has beeen an adventure to say the least, but that time in my life is done now. I will continue to cook as a hobby and I still feel very much at home in the kitchen.</p>
			<p>I went to NYU to get my bachaelor's degree in History and Food Studies. I found that I had a passion for history as well. I have fun analyzing different points in history and understand their mindsets and how decisions effect people, the environment, and technology.</p> -->

			<!-- <p>I still very much love to cook. I still have my Julia Child cookbooks from when I was little and still use them to this day, especially when I'm baking.</p>
			<p>HI really love unsolved mysteries. When I hear about one on the internet or Netflix, I immediately start researching what happened and find all the facts and figures related to the event. I'm probably going to become an armchair detective.</p> -->
